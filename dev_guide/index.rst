Developer Guide
================================

Welcome to the CryptPad Developer Guide.

This guide explains how to set up a local development environment, the inner workings of CryptPad, and how to contribute to the project.

.. note::
    Please note that due to its length and technical nature this guide is not part of the translations for the CryptPad documentation. It is presented in English only. Adding it to the translation would add a substantial volume of text for translators that may discourage them from work on the more widely useful :ref:`user_guide`.
