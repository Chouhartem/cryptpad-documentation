How to contribute

   Work in Progress

There are various ways to contribute to CryptPad, many of which do not require any coding skills.

Spread the word
---------------

The simplest way to help CryptPad is to make the project known. As an Open Source project, CryptPad has very little budget to spare for marketing. We rely on the community to promote the service, for example by:

- Using CrytpPad and demonstrating it to friends and colleagues, highlighting why privacy is important.
- Posting about CryptPad on social media.
- Following and relaying our own communications from our `Blog <https://blog.cryptpad.fr>`__, from `Mastodon <https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad>`__ or `Twitter <https://twitter.com/cryptpad>`__.
- Relaying the `CryptPad Crowdfunding <https://opencollective.com/cryptpad>`__.
- Presenting CryptPad in conferences or meetups, or inviting the team to present. If you need help contact us on the `#cryptpad matrix channel <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cryptpad:matrix.org>`__.



.. _contribute_bugs:

Report bugs
-----------

If you encounter a problem with CryptPad, reporting it helps improve the service for everyone. When reporting, please provide as much information as possible about the conditions in which the problem occurred, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead. These details help the team reproduce the error, which is the first step towards fixing it.

There are two ways to report bugs or issues:

- Cryptpad's built in :ref:`support ticket system <user_support>` you can message instance administrators. These messages are encrypted like everything else on CryptPad.

-  `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/new/choose>`__ to file the issue publicly using the bug report template. (A Github account is needed to submit issues)


.. _contribute_translation:

Translate CryptPad
------------------

The CryptPad team translates the software in English and French, with many more languages provided by the community. Translating CryptPad—and/or keeping translations up to date as the platform develops—is a much needed effort to make it available to as many people as possible.

Translations include all text in CryptPad itself, as well as this documentation.

For more information see the `Translation guide <https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/master/customize.dist/translations/README.md>`__.
