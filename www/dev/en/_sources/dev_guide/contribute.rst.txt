Pull requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source code is published on GitHub. We accept contributions in the form of "pull requests" and we'll try to respond as quickly as possible. The response time will depend on the complexity of the changes made and the current workload of the development team.

Branches
^^^^^^^^

Contributions can be based on the ``main`` branch which is updated with each release and contains stable code. Experienced contributors can also work on the ``staging`` branch which usually contains code planned for the next release and/or under development. This code may be unstable, so the use of this branch is usually discouraged.

Before contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before sending the "pull request" to GitHub, it is important to:

-  test the code
-  ensure compliance with our coding rules
   -  the ``npm run lint`` command will list syntax errors and inconsistencies
-  describe the changes and why they were made in the message
