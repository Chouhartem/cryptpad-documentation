.. warning::

    The integration of OnlyOffice with Cryptpadâ€™s encrypted real-time
    collaboration does not include some of the functionality that is
    available in the other applications. Namely, **Templates** are not yet available but will be in a future release.

Documentation
-------------

Please refer to the `OnlyOffice
documentation <https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/en/ONLYOFFICE-Editors/ONLYOFFICE-Spreadsheet-Editor/index.aspx>`__
for a spreadsheet user-guide.

.. _sheets_history:

History
-------


Due to the integration of OnlyOffice with CryptPad's encrypted real-time collaboration, history in speadsheets works differently than :ref:`in the other applications <document_history>`.

   The spreadsheet history toolbar

History in spreadsheets only allows to jump back to the previous version, and then move forward through individual edits.

- |fast-backward| previous version
- |step-forward| step forward one edit
- |fast-forward| next version

The functionality to restore and share a version, as well as everything relating to :ref:`snapshots`, works in the same way as in :ref:`the other applications <document_history>`.
