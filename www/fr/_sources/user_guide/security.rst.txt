.. _passwords:

Passwords for documents and folders
-----------------------------------

:badge:`Logged in users`

When you share the link to a document or shared folder through an
insecure channel (for example email or SMS), someone might intercept the
link and gain access to your data. To prevent this from happening, the
:ref:`owners <owners>` of a document or folder can add a password.

When you share documents with your contacts and teams directly on
CryptPad, communications are encrypted and we assume that you want to
give them access. Therefore the password is remembered and sent with the
pad when you share it. The recipient, or yourself, are **not** asked for
it when they open the document.

You can add a password to a document when you :ref:`create <new_document>` it.

You can also add or change the password in the :ref:`access` menu:

* From the CryptDrive: ``Right click`` > |unlock-alt| **Access**.
* From the document toolbar: |unlock-alt| **Access**.

Remote Disconnect
-----------------

:badge:`Logged in users`

In some cases (loss or theft of a device, forgotten to log out of a
session on a shared computer, etc.) it can be necessary to close all
active CryptPad sessions. This can be done in two ways:

* User menu (avatar at the top-right) > |gear| **Settings** > |lock| **Confidentiality** > **Close remote sessions**. 

This option logs out all sessions **except** the one from which it is actiaved.

* User menu (avatar at the top-right) > |plug| **Log out everywhere**. 

This option logs out all sessions **including** the one from which it is activated.
