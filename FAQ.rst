What is the relationship between CryptPad and OnlyOffice?
---------------------------------------------------------

OnlyOffice is only used for spreadsheets in CryptPad. Our various other editors were developed entirely independent of their codebase. We've completely removed the dependence on OnlyOffice's document server and we only use their spreadsheet editor's client-side code. Their encryption system was developed after ours and bears no relation. Finally, the file format conversion tools covered in this article are based on their code, but we did a considerable amount of work to get it to run in all modern browsers, rather than on their server, so as to avoid the need to reveal the contents of users' documents when converting.
