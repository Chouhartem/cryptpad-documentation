# CryptPad instances

CryptPad is free software. It can be installed by whoever wants to provide this service in a personal or professional capacity. 

This documentation is written and maintained by the development team at XWiki SAS in Paris, France. This team administers the flagship instance at cryptpad.fr, but there are many others. This documentation should apply to all instances unless explicitly mentionned. 

Please note that this documentation is kept up to date with the latest version of CryptPad [version number]. It is possible that other instances are using earlier versions. Each instance can also have specific settings such as storage space, disabled applications, or custom colors/styles.

If you are looking to set up a CryptPad instance please refer to the [Installation Guide].
