History
-------


Due to the integration of OnlyOffice with CryptPad's encrypted real-time collaboration, history in speadsheets works differently than :ref:`in the other applications <document_history>`.

   The spreadsheet history toolbar

History in spreadsheets only allows to jump back to the previous version, and then move forward through individual edits.

- |fast-backward| previous version
- |step-forward| step forward one edit
- |fast-forward| next version

The functionality to restore and share a version, as well as everything relating to :ref:`snapshots`, works in the same way as in :ref:`the other applications <document_history>`.

Printing
--------

To print spreadsheets it is recommended to export using one of the formats below and to handle page layout with a desktop application such as Libre Office.

Alternatively the ``.pdf`` export can be used to produce file for print, results may vary depending on the layout of the document.
