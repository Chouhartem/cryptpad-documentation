"requirements when it comes to usage, for example someone responding to a "
"form should be able to edit their own answers but not other users' "
"answers or the form itself. For this reason the "
":ref:`share_access_rights` when sharing a form are different from the "
"other applications. Forms have 3 different roles:"
