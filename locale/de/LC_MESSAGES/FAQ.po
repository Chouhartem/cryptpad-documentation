"Making CryptPad compatible with a wide range of document formats is an "
"ongoing challenge for the development team. Unfortunately the technology "
"for converting documents in the browser still has limitations, especially"

"To address these problems, the development team is working on making "
"CryptPad a \"Progressive Web App\". This means that it can be used on "

"The CryptPad :ref:`app_sheets` application is an integration of "
"`OnlyOffice Spreadsheets <https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/spreadsheet-"
"editor.aspx>`_. However, this only concerns the client-side code, "
"CryptPad does not make use of the OnlyOffice Document Server. CryptPad's "
"encrypted collaboration, used for spreadsheets and other applications, is"
" completely different from the encryption system used in parts of "
"upstream OnlyOffice. Some of CryptPad's file format conversion tools are "
"based on OnlyOffice code, but substantial work has been done to make it "
"run in the browser rather than on the server, therefore avoiding the need"
" to reveal the contents of users' documents when converting."
