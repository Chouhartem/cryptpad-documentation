"The functionality as well as the look-and-feel of an instance can be "
"customized by creating a ``customize`` folder and copying assets to be "
"customized (images, stylesheets, page templates, etc) from "

" served to users instead of its namesake in ``customize.dist``."

" a major new version may introduce breaking changes or require "
"adjustments in the customizations. Administrators with customized "
